# traveling_salesman_solver
Cli program to solve TSP by using the nearest neighbor algorithm

This is a visual example of an complete undirected weighted graph. The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.
